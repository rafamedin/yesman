> Hi there!
Howdy! It's a beautiful day in the Mojave. What can I do for you?

> Tell me a joke.
Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

> Can you tell me about the NCR?
The NCR might have their flaws, but they're trying to bring order to the wasteland.

> What's the deal with the Legion?
Caesar's Legion? They're a force to be reckoned with, that's for sure.

> Thanks for the info.
No problem, partner! Happy to help. Anything else you need?

> Bye
Exiting. Watch out for Deathclaws out there. Have a great day!
